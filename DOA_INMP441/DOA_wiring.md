the spacing is 8cm between each mic (can change in code)

                Front mic (L)
                    ^
    LEFT mic (L) < 8cm  >  RIGHT mic (R)
                    |
                BACK mic (R)

## Wiring
1. Follow the code for WS, SCK, SD
    [WS (6), SCK (5), SD (for L+R=4,F+B=7)]

2. GND is GND
